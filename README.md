Chrome Quick Switch Tab
===

Creates a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + T) to bring up a quick tab switch popup.
This extension is inspired from textmate's `Go To File` (cmd + T) popup.
This quick tab switch popup will show a list of currently opened tabs ordered by last access time. Also you can quickly search between open tabs and switch to it.
